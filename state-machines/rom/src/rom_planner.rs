    /// * `metrics` - A vector of tuples where:
    ///   - The first element is a `ChunkId` that identifies the source of the metric.
    ///   - The second element is a boxed implementation of `BusDeviceMetrics`, which must be a
    ///     `RomCounter`.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A vector containing one `Plan` instance that defines the execution flow for ROM operations.
    ///
    /// # Panics
    /// This method panics if the `metrics` vector is empty.
