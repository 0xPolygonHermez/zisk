//! The `BinaryCounter` module defines a device for tracking and processing binary-related operations
//! sent over the data bus. It serves a purpose:
//! - Counting different types of binary operations, to decide if uses specific add instances or not.
//!
//! This module implements the `Metrics` and `BusDevice` traits, enabling seamless integration with
//! the system bus for both monitoring and input generation.
