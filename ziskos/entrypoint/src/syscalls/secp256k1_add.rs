/// Performs the addition of two points on the Secp256k1 curve, storing the result in the first point.
///
/// The `Secp256k1Add` system call executes a CSR set on a custom port. When transpiling from RISC-V to Zisk,
/// this instruction is replaced with a precompiled operationâ€”specifically, `Secp256k1Add`.
///
/// `Secp256k1Add` operates on two points, each with two coordinates of 256 bits.
/// Each coordinate is represented as an array of four `u64` elements.
/// The syscall takes as a parameter the address of a structure containing points `p1` and `p2`.
/// The result of the addition is stored in `p1`.
///
/// ### Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure that `p1` is a valid pointer to data that is aligned to an eight-byte boundary.
///
/// The caller must ensure that both `p1` and `p2` coordinates are within the range of the Secp256k1 base field.
///
/// The resulting point will have both coordinates in the range of the Secp256k1 base field.
