/// Executes the doubling of a point on the Bn254 curve.
///
/// The `syscall_bn254_curve_dbl` system call executes a CSR set on a custom port. When transpiling from RISC-V to Zisk,
/// this instruction is replaced with a precompiled operationâ€”specifically, `Bn254CurveDbl`.
///
/// `syscall_bn254_curve_dbl` operates on a point with two coordinates, each consisting of 256 bits.
/// Each coordinate is represented as an array of four `u64` elements. The syscall takes as a parameter
/// the address of the point, and the result of the doubling operation is stored at the same location.
///
/// ### Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure that `p1` is a valid pointer to data that is aligned to an eight-byte boundary.
///
/// The caller must ensure that `p1` coordinates are within the range of the BN254 base field.
///
/// The resulting point will have both coordinates in the range of the BN254 base field.
