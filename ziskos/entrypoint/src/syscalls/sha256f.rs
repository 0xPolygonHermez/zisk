/// The `Sha256` system call executes a CSR set on a custom port. When transpiling from RISC-V to Zisk,
/// this instruction is replaced with a precompiled operationâ€”specifically, `Sha256`.
///
/// The syscall takes as a parameter the address of a state data (512 bits = 64 bytes)
/// and the result of the sha256f operation is stored at the same location
///
/// ### Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure that the data is aligned to a 64-bit boundary.
