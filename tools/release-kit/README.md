# ZisK Release Kit

## Build docker image
To build the `zisk-test-env` Docker image, execute the following command:

```bash
./build_docker.sh
```

## Run docker container
To run the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
./run-docker.sh
```

This will run Docker container and fopen the Release Kit menu inside the container. If the container already exists, you will be asked whether you want to connect to it or recreate it.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>If you choose to recreate the container, all existing content inside it will be lost.

> [!TIP]
>
>The Docker container includes a `${HOME}/output` directory, which is mapped to the `./output` folder on the host.  
>You can use this folder to copy any files you want to make available outside of the container.

## Menu Options

1. **Edit environment variables**  
   Opens the `.env` file with the `nano` editor, allowing you to modify environment variable values.  
   These variables let you specify the repository branches to use, the setup version to generate or install, and the parameters to use when proving in distributed mode.

2. **Build ZisK from source**  
   Builds ZisK using the `zisk` and `pil2-proofman` repository sources (checking out the branches specified in the environment variables).  
   After building, it installs the CLI tools and necessary files to the `$HOME/.zisk` folder and adds that folder to the `$PATH` environment variable.

3. **Build setup from source**  
   Builds the setup files (proving key) using the `pil2-proofman`, `pil2-proofman-js`, and `pil2-compiler` repository sources (checking out the branches specified in the environment variables).  
   After building, it installs the proving key to the `$HOME/.zisk` folder and generates the constant files using the `cargo-zisk check-setup` command.

4. **Package setup outcome**  
   Packages the setup artifacts (`.tar.gz` and `.md5` files for proving and verifying keys) using the setup files generated in option 3.  
   The artifacts are stored in the `${HOME}/output` directory inside the container, which is mapped to the `./output` folder on the host, making them available externally.

5. **Install ZisK from binaries**
   Test ZisK installation from binaries using the lastest official release.

6. **Test sha_hasher**  
   Creates, builds, and emulates the `sha_hasher` program, then generates and verifies the proof.  
   It also performs constraints verification.

7. **Test Pessimistic Proof**  
   Tests the pessimistic proof program using files from the `zisk-testvectors` repository.  
   First, it proves the input files specified in the `PP_INPUTS` environment variable in non-distributed mode. Then, it proves the input files specified in the `PP_INPUTS_DISTRIBUTED` environment variable in distributed mode.

8. **Test Ethereum Block**  
   Tests Ethereum block proof generation using files from the `zisk-testvectors` repository.  
   First, it proves the input files specified in the `BLOCK_INPUTS` environment variable in non-distributed mode. Then, it proves the input files specified in the `BLOCK_INPUTS_DISTRIBUTED` environment variable in distributed mode.

9. **Install setup from public packages**  
   Downloads and installs the proving key files from the public packages corresponding to the `SETUP_VERSION` environment variable.  
   After installation, it generates the constant files using the `cargo-zisk check-setup` command.

10. **Install setup from local packages**  
   Installs the proving key files using the setup packages generated by option `4. Package setup outcome`, which must be located in the `${HOME}/output` directory.
   After installation, it generates the constant files using the `cargo-zisk check-setup` command.

11. **Shell**  
    Opens a command line shell inside the container.  
    When you exit the shell, you will return to the Release Kit menu.

12. **Exit**  
   Exits the Release Kit container and returns to the host shell.
