//! Zisk ROM
//!
//! # ROM data
//!
//! The Zisk ROM contains the result of parsing a RISC-V ELF program file data, and then keeping the
//! data that is required to execute any input data against this program using the Zisk processor.
//! This information consists on the following data:
//!
//! ## Zisk instructions
//!
//! * Created by transpiling the RISC-V instructions
//! * Every RISC-V instruction can generate a different number of Zisk instructions: 1 (in most of
//!   the cases), 2, 3 or 4 (e.g. in instruction containing some atomic operations).
//! * For this reason, Zisk instructions addresses are normally spaced 4 units (e.g. 4096, 4100,
//!   4104...) leaving room for up to 3 additional Zisk instructions if needed to fulfill the
//!   original RISC-V instruction they represent.
//! * This way, RISC-V jumps can conveniently be mapped to Zisk jumps by multiplying their relative
//!   offsets by 4.
//! * The Zisk instructions are stored in a map using the pc as the key
//!
//! ## Read-only (RO) data
//!
//! * RISC-V programs can contain some data that is required to execute the program, e.g. constants.
//! * There can be several sections of RO memory-mapped data in the same RISC-V program, so we need
//!   to store a list of them as part of the ROM.
//! * There can be none, one, or several.
//!
//! # Fetching instructions
//!
//! * During the Zisk program execution, the Zisk Emulator must fetch the Zisk instruction
//!   corresponding to the current pc for every execution step.
//! * This fetch can be expensive in terms of computational time if done directly using the map.
//! * For this reason, the original map of instructions is split into 3 different containers that
//!   allow to speed-up the process of finding the Zisk instruction that matches a specific pc
//!   addresss.
//! * The logic of this fetch procedure can be seen in the method `get_instruction()`.  This method
//!   searches for the Zisk instruction in 3 different containers:
//!   * If the address is >= `ROM_ADDR`, there can be 2 cases:
//!     * If the address is alligned to 4 bytes, then get it from the vector `rom_instructions`,
//!       using as index `(pc-ROM_ADDR)/4`
//!     * If the address is not allgined, then get it from the vector `rom_na_instructions`, using
//!       as index `(pc-ROM_ADDR)`
//!   * If the address is < ROM_ADDR, then get it from the vector `rom_entry_instructions`, using as
//!     index `(pc-ROM_ENTRY)/4`
