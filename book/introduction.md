# Introduction

Welcome to the [ZisK](https://github.com/0xpolygonhermez) Documentation

ZisK is a high-performance zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs of arbitrary program execution. It enables developers to prove the correctness of a computation without revealing its internal state, making ZisK a powerful tool for privacy-preserving and verifiable computation.

ZisK abstracts these complexities through an optimized toolstack that minimizes computational overhead, enabling any developer to harness zero-knowledge technology regardless of their cryptographic background. With Rust-based execution and planned multi-language support, ZisK makes privacy-preserving proofs as straightforward to implement as any other development tool, Without sacrificing performance or security.
  
## Why ZisK?
