# Introduction

ZisK is a high-performance zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) designed to generate zero-knowledge proofs of arbitrary program execution. It enables developers to prove the correctness of a computation without revealing its internal state, making ZisK a powerful tool for privacy-preserving and verifiable computation.

Proving systems traditionally involve complex cryptographic operations that require deep expertise and significant computational resources. ZisK abstracts these complexities by providing an optimized toolstack that minimizes computational overhead, making ZK technology accessible to a broader range of developers. With Rust-based execution and planned multi-language support, ZisK is designed to be developer-friendly while maintaining high performance and robust security.

## Why ZisK?
- High-performance architecture optimized for low-latency proof generation.
- Rust-based zkVM, with future support for additional languages.
- No recompilation required across different programs.
- Standardized prover interface (JSON-RPC, GRPC, CLI).
- Flexible integration: usable as a standalone service or as a library.
- Decentralized architecture for trustless proof generation.
- Optimized proof generation costs for real-world applications.
- Fully open-source and backed by Polygon zkEVM and Plonky3 technology.
