# Introduction

**Polygon ZisK** provides a highly performant Zero-Knowledge (ZK) prover, designed to deliver exceptional speed and efficiency in generating and verifying ZK proofs. It supports Rust-based programs, with plans to expand to other languages, making it an ideal solution for integrating ZK technology into new or existing projects

One of the key advantages of ZisK is its ability to reduce the complexity of cryptographic operations. ZK proofs are traditionally challenging to implement due to their computational intensity and the need for specialized knowledge. ZisK addresses these challenges by providing a high-performance solution that minimizes the computational overhead, making ZK proofs more accessible to a wider range of developers. This allows programmers to focus more on building innovative applications while ensuring robust privacy and security features.

## ZisK Advantages
- Architecture designed for low latency
- Rust generation proving system
- Prover/Verifier does not need to be recompiled for each proof
- Prover standard interface (JSON-RPC, GRPC, CLI)
- Prover can be used as a library in your own code
- Decentralized architecture
- Low proof generation cost
- Fully open source
- Based on Polygon zkEVM and Plonky3 proving technology
