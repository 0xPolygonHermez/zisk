# Overview
## How ZisK Works

ZisK approaches zero-knowledge virtual machine design by treating proof generation not as an afterthought, but as an integral part of the execution process itself. Instead of the traditional "execute first, prove later" model, ZisK implements **proof-native execution** where every computational step simultaneously advances program execution and contributes to cryptographic proof generation.

**What You'll Learn:** This overview covers ZisK's unified execution and proving approach, the specialized RISC-V implementation, the modular state machine architecture, and the bus communication system. We'll walk through the execution pipeline from Rust code to verified proofs, showing how ZisK's purpose-built design improves efficiency and developer experience.

### The Core Innovation: Execution and Proving as One Process

Traditional zkVMs follow a linear pipeline: compile → execute → trace → prove → verify. This creates inefficiencies because the execution environment isn't optimized for proof generation, leading to expensive trace reconstruction and constraint satisfaction steps.

ZisK wraps this pipeline into a unified process where:

-   **Program execution**  generates execution traces in real-time
-   **Constraint satisfaction**  happens during execution, not after
-   **Witness generation**  occurs incrementally as the program runs
-   **Proof construction**  begins immediately without waiting for execution completion

This architectural unity means that by the time a program finishes executing, most of the cryptographic proof work is already complete.

### RISC-V Architecture: Optimized for Zero-Knowledge

ZisK implements the RISC-V 64-bit instruction set (`riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf`) with specific optimizations for zero-knowledge proving:

**Instruction Set Design:**

-   **Reduced complexity**: ~100 carefully selected instructions vs. 200+ in full RISC-V
-   **Deterministic execution**: Every instruction has predictable behavior and cycle counts
-   **Constraint-friendly operations**: Instructions chosen for efficient mathematical representation
-   **Custom extensions**: ZisK-specific instructions for I/O and proof hints

**Memory Model:**  ZisK's memory architecture balances RISC-V compatibility with proving requirements:

```
Memory Layout:
├── ROM (Program Code): Immutable, verified as part of proof setup
├── RAM (Runtime Data): Dynamic allocation with bounded growth
├── Stack: Deterministic growth patterns for predictable constraints
└── I/O Space: Specialized region for input/output operations
```

The key insight is that every memory access becomes part of the execution trace, so the memory layout is optimized to generate efficient constraint representations.

## State Machine Architecture: Specialized Processing Units

ZisK decomposes computation into specialized state machines, each optimized for specific mathematical domains. Rather than using a monolithic processor, ZisK recognizes that arithmetic, memory, and binary operations have fundamentally different constraint requirements. This specialization enables targeted optimizations and parallel processing that would be impossible in a general-purpose design:

### Core State Machines

**Main State Machine**: Acts as the orchestrator, coordinating all other components and managing the global execution flow. It doesn't perform computations itself but ensures proper sequencing and data flow.

**Arithmetic State Machine**: Handles all mathematical operations with sub-machines for:

-   Complete arithmetic operations (ArithFullSM)
-   Lookup table optimizations (ArithTableSM)
-   Range checking operations (ArithRangeTableSM)

**Binary State Machine**: Manages bitwise and logical operations through:

-   Basic binary operations (AND, OR, XOR)
-   Extended binary logic for complex bit manipulation
-   Optimized binary addition with efficient constraint generation

**Memory State Machine**: Controls all memory access with specialized handling for:

-   Core memory operations and access validation
-   Unaligned memory access (crucial for RISC-V compatibility)
-   Input data and ROM data with optimized access patterns

**ROM State Machine**: Manages program storage, instruction fetching, and maintains execution statistics for optimization.

### Why This Architecture Works

This decomposition provides several advantages:

-   **Specialized optimization**: Each domain can be optimized independently
-   **Parallel execution**: Independent operations can run simultaneously
-   **Constraint efficiency**: Each state machine generates constraints optimized for its operation type
-   **Modularity**: New computational domains can be added without affecting existing ones

## Bus Communication System: The Nervous System

The bus system connects all state machines through a specialized communication protocol designed specifically for proof generation. Unlike traditional computer buses that simply move data, ZisK's bus captures every communication as part of the execution trace, turning inter-component data flow into cryptographic evidence. This design ensures that all system interactions contribute to the overall proof while enabling efficient distributed operation across multiple machines.
rust

```rust
// Every component implements the unified BusDevice interface
pub trait BusDevice<D>: Any + Send + Sync {
    fn process_data(&mut self, bus_id: &BusId, data: &[D], 
                   pending: &mut VecDeque<(BusId, Vec<D>)>);
    fn bus_id(&self) -> Vec<BusId>;
}
```

**How Bus Communication Works:**

1.  **Operation Request**: A state machine needs to communicate with another component
2.  **Bus Routing**: The system routes data to the correct destination using BusId
3.  **Queue Management**: Operations are queued and processed asynchronously
4.  **Trace Integration**: Every communication becomes part of the execution trace
5.  **Constraint Generation**: Bus operations contribute to the overall proof constraints

This isn't just data movement—it's creating the mathematical evidence needed for zero-knowledge proofs.

## Execution Pipeline: From Code to Proof

### 1. Compilation Phase

`cargo-zisk build` compiles Rust code to the specialized RISC-V target. This isn't standard compilation—the toolchain produces ELF binaries optimized for zero-knowledge proving with deterministic execution guarantees.

-   Cross-compilation to `riscv64ima-zisk-zkvm-elf`
-   Integration with ZisK runtime libraries
-   Optimization for deterministic execution patterns

### 2. ROM Setup Phase

`cargo-zisk rom-setup` analyzes the compiled program and prepares the cryptographic infrastructure. This one-time setup creates the mathematical framework needed to prove execution of this specific program.

-   Extracts instruction sequences and program structure
-   Generates program-specific PIL constraints
-   Creates cryptographic commitments to the program code
-   Pre-computes constant polynomials that don't change between executions

### 3. Execution and Proving Phase

`cargo-zisk prove` runs the program while simultaneously generating the proof. This is where ZisK's unified architecture shines—execution and proof generation happen together, not sequentially.

-   **ZisK Emulator** executes RISC-V instructions
-   **State machines** handle specialized computations
-   **Bus system** manages communication and trace generation
-   **Constraint evaluation** happens in real-time
-   **STARK proof generation** occurs during execution

### 4. Verification Phase

`cargo-zisk verify` validates the generated proof. The verification process is designed to be fast and efficient, enabling practical deployment even in resource-constrained environments.

-   Efficient verification algorithm (logarithmic in execution length)
-   Public input validation
-   Cryptographic proof verification using Vadcop recursion
## Why This Architecture Matters

Traditional zkVMs are essentially retrofitted systems—taking existing virtual machine designs and adding zero-knowledge capabilities on top. This approach works but creates fundamental inefficiencies.

ZisK's architecture emerges naturally from the mathematical requirements of zero-knowledge proofs. Every design decision—from the instruction set to the bus system to the state machine decomposition—is optimized for efficient proof generation.

The result is a system that doesn't just generate zero-knowledge proofs—it does so efficiently, scalably, and with a developer experience that makes zkVM programming accessible to mainstream developers.

This architectural coherence means that ZisK can achieve performance levels that are difficult or impossible for retrofitted systems, while providing a foudation for future innovations in verifiable computation.
