# ZisK

ZisK is an innovative and high-performance zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) developed by Polygon that enables trustless, verifiable computation, allowing developers to generate and verify proofs for arbitrary program execution efficiently.

ZisK aims to provide a flexible and developer-friendly zkVM, with Rust as its primary language for writing provable programs, with planned support for other languages in the future. By abstracting complex zero-knowledge proof generation, ZisK simplifies the integration of ZK technology into scalable, private, and secure applications across blockchain ecosystems and beyond.

## Getting Started

To start using ZisK, follow the [Quickstart](https://0xpolygonhermez.github.io/zisk/getting_started/quickstart.html) guide.
